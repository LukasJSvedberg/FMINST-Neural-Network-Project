# FMINST-Neural-Network-Project
Using pytorch, I created two machine learning models which can classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. I created two models which do this: <br>
- one non linear model <br>
- one convolutional neural network <br>
<br>
I did this through following Daniel Bourke's course, 'PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning â€“ Full Course' on youtube channel 'freecodecamp' <br>
